<https://crates.io/crates/perg>

A fast, feature-rich text search tool similar to [`grep`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html), written in Rust.

perg is a modern implementation of the classic grep utility, designed for speed and ease of use. It supports regular expressions, recursive directory searching, and various output formatting options.

## Features

- **Fast text searching** with regular expression support
- **Recursive directory search** with the `-r` flag
- **Case-insensitive matching** with the `-i` flag
- **Line number display** with the `-n` flag
- **Filename display** with the `-H` flag
- **Invert match** (show non-matching lines) with the `-v` flag
- **Files with/without matches** listing with `-l`/`-L` flags
- **Count matching lines** with the `-c` flag
- **Show only matching parts** with the `-o` flag
- **Context lines** with `-B` (before), `-A` (after), and `-C` (around) flags
- **Limit matches** with the `-m` flag
- **Multiple file/directory support**
- **Proper error handling** and exit codes

```bash

A fast, feature-rich text search tool similar to grep, written in Rust

          Print NUM lines of output context [default: 0]
  -m, --max-count <MAX_COUNT>
          Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines
  -o, --only-matching

## Usage

A `test.md` file is included in this repo for testing:

```bash
$ cat test.md
hello world hi world bye world end of file Title
```

### Basic Usage

Search for a pattern in a file:

```bash
$ perg hello test.md
hello world
```

### Advanced Features

**Line numbers:**

```bash
$ perg -n world test.md
1:hello world
2:hi world
3:bye world
```

**Case insensitive search:**

```bash
$ perg -i title test.md
Title
```

**Invert match (show lines that DON'T match):**

```bash
$ perg -v world test.md
end of file
Title
```

**Recursive directory search:**

```bash
perg -r "pattern" /path/to/directory
```

**Show filenames with matches:**

```bash
$ perg -l world test.md
test.md
```

**Show filenames without matches:**

```bash
$ perg -L world test.md
# (shows files that don't contain "world")
```

**Count matching lines:**

```bash
$ perg -c world test.md
test.md:2
```

**Show only matching parts:**

```bash
$ perg -o 'h[ei]' test.md
hello
hi
```

**Context lines around matches:**

```bash
# Show 1 line before and after each match
$ perg -B 1 -A 1 'pattern' file.txt

# Show 2 lines of context around matches
$ perg -C 2 'pattern' file.txt
```

**Limit number of matches:**

```bash
$ perg -m 2 'pattern' file.txt
# Show only the first 2 matches
```

**Multiple files:**

```bash
$ perg -H pattern file1.txt file2.txt
file1.txt:matching line
file2.txt:another match
```

**Regular expressions:**

```bash
$ perg "h[ei]" test.md
hello world
hi world

$ perg "hello|bye" test.md
hello world
bye world

$ perg "^(be)" test.md
bye world
end of file
```

**Combined options:**

```bash
perg -r -i -n "error" /var/log/
```

## Installation

### From Crates.io

Using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) via `rustup`:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Then install `perg`:

```bash
cargo install perg
```

Note: If you see "cargo command not found", restart your terminal and run the install command again.

### From Source

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinhnx/perg.git
cd perg
cargo build --release
./target/release/perg --help
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: Success, matches found (or no matches when using `-L`)
- `1`: File not found or other I/O errors
- `2`: Invalid regular expression

## Project Structure

This project is organized as follows:

```
src/
